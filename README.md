### Inception-of-Things (IoT)
This project is a System Administration exercise focusing on utilizing K3s and K3d with Vagrant. It guides users through setting up virtual machines, installing Kubernetes, deploying applications, and configuring namespaces.

# Chapter I: Mandatory Part
  - Part 1: K3s and Vagrant
  This section guides users through setting up two virtual machines using Vagrant, configuring networking, and installing K3s with SSH access.

  - Part 2: K3s and three simple applications
  Participants will learn to deploy three web applications on a single virtual machine with K3s in server mode. Ingress rules will be configured to route requests based on the HOST header.

  - Part 3: K3d and Argo CD
  This part focuses on installing K3D, setting up namespaces for Argo CD, and automating application deployment from a GitHub repository.

# Chapter II : Bonus Part
An optional bonus task involves integrating Gitlab into the existing setup, configuring it to work with the cluster, and ensuring seamless operation.
